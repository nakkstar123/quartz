## About Me

Hello! I'm Nakul, an incoming PhD student at UCLA. I'm interested in the research and deployment of *practical cryptography*. I like writing about cute ideas that I encounter in my research. I've procrastinated publishing these because they're unfinished but I'd argue that this is a good way to keep myself accountable.
